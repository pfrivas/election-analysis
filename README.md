## Election Audit Summary
### Buisness Proposal to the Election Commision

This python program would be great for analyzing a multitude of different aspects of voters and voter turnout in a fast and efficient way, as well as building an algorithim to help with election result verification. 

### Possible Modifications
- This python script could be modified to analyze voter demographics and where the turnout is the best for certain demographics which could help in the strategic planning of future campaigns. 
- This python script could  be modified to include a wider range of analysis for bigger elections such as a state election or country election
